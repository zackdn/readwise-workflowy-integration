# Workflowy/Readwise Integration

The contents of this file can be run directly in your browser console and it will import all of your Readwise highlights by book and import them into whatever WF node you have open at the time.

# Features

- **Bulk Import**
    - You can open a blank WF node and run the script to import your entire Readwise library!
- **Organization**
    - Every resource (books, articles, tweets, podcasts, etc.) will be a bullet...
            - With each highlight nested under the appropriate resource...
                - And each highlight's note nested under the highlight
- **Tagging**
    - Each book (or tweet, article, podcast, etc.) will be tagged with the kind of resource it is
    - Books containing personal notes on highlights will be tagged with "#readwise_notes"
- **Links and Other Meta**
    - Resources like articles that include a link will be automatically turned into a link in WF
    - Other useful meta like the author, date highlighted, and more are included as notes
